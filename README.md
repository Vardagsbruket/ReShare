# ReShare - A Collaborative Project

Welcome to ReShare, a collaborative effort by [Filza Saleem](https://github.com/filzasaleem), [Diana Unden](https://github.com/Vardagsbruket), and [Joona Miettinen](https://github.com/joona-3), developed as the final project for Technigo's upskill course in JavaScript and React.

## Experience ReShare

Explore the live version of ReShare [here](https://stirring-florentine-c4bb3f.netlify.app/) and witness firsthand how we're transforming the idea of ownership into a shared experience. Thank you for joining us on this journey towards a more sustainable and collaborative way of living.

## Overview

Welcome to ReShare, our final project developed during Technigo's upskill course in JavaScript and React. At the heart of ReShare is a mission aligned with Agenda 2030 â€“ addressing societal challenges through innovative solutions. ReShare is our response to the challenge of addressing significant societal issues in line with the principles of Agenda 2030. Our collective mission was to craft a solution that contributes positively to the world, focusing on the outlined goals of Agenda 2030. Leveraging the capabilities of JavaScript and React, ReShare aims to make a meaningful impact on pressing societal challenges.

## Mission

Our primary objective is to contribute to the global effort of mitigating overconsumption. ReShare provides a platform where neighbors can connect to lend each other seldom-used items, fostering a sense of community and reducing the need for individual ownership. Examples include drilling machines, car trailers, skis, and more. The app enables users to share items they have available for lending or express their need to borrow something. Additionally, we've integrated a feature to facilitate the giving away of items that are no longer needed but still hold value.

## Key Features

- **Item Sharing:** Share posts about items you're willing to lend or borrow.
- **Community Giving:** Contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle by giving away items that still have utility.
- **Reduced Overconsumption:** Encourage responsible consumption by promoting the sharing economy within local communities.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the development of ReShare:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): The programming language used for both front-end and back-end development.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server): A fake API implemented using a JSON file to simulate responses during development.
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/): Official React bindings for Redux, a predictable state container.
- [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/): A set of utilities to reduce boilerplate in Redux logic.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): A standard library for routing in React applications.
- [react-share](https://github.com/nygardk/react-share): A React component for social media sharing functionality.
