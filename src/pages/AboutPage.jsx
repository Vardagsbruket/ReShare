        <h1>ReShare: Technigo's Upskill Project in JavaScript and React</h1>
      <p>
        This is app is created as our final project for Technigo's upskill
        course i JavaScript and React. The mission was to create a project that
        would focus on a societal challenge in accordance with Agenda 2030
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this app is to help mitigate over consumption by
        providing a platform where neighbours can offer to lend each other
        things that you seldom use, but sill need occasionally. Examples are
        drilling machines, trailers for your car and skies. You can both share a
        post with things you have available or post that you are in need of
        borrowing something. We also wanted to provide the opportunity to give
        away things you no longer need, but that still has good usage value.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is built using React Vite, Redux, React routes and JSON-Server.
